# COMMANDS

## Ax

Ax is a primary command of the ax.nvim plugin and is used to remove a file from the disk and also from various vim lists. It modifies global variables: oldfiles, jumplist and changelist.

Usage:

```vim
:Ax
:Ax {path}
```

## AxForget

Identical to Ax, but it won't delete an existing file.

Usage:

```vim
:AxForget {path}
```

## AxMove

AxMove is used to move a file to a new location. It also updates various vim lists to reflect the new location of the file.

Usage:

:AxMove % {destination}
```

## AxAudit

AxAudit is used to generate a report that lists paths remembered by vim, but no longer exist. It also provides script to clear them.

```vim
:AxAudit
```
