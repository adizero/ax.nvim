AX PLUGIN                                              *ax-nvim*

Ax is a Neovim plugin that provides a convenient way to delete files,
cleansing them from various Neovim data structures such as oldfiles,
jumplists, quickfix lists, and more.

INSTALLATION ~

The plugin can be installed using vim-plug or lazy.nvim package managers.

For vim-plug:

1. Add the following line to your vimrc within the plug block:

    Plug 'mikeslattery/ax.nvim'

2. Then, run `:PlugInstall` in Neovim to install the plugin.

For lazy.nvim package manager:

1. Add this within your lazy.nvim configuration Lua table:

    {
      dir = "~/path/to/ax.nvim",
      setup = function() require("ax").setup() end,
      config = function() require("ax").config({/* your config */}) end,
    }

    The `dir` field should be the path to the locally cloned repository or can be omitted to fetch automatically from GitHub.

2. Follow the setup instructions of lazy.nvim to complete the installation.

USAGE ~

After installing ax, you can use the provided `:Ax` command to delete the
current buffer's associated file and cleanse its references from Neovim's
data structures.

README at https://github.com/mikeslattery/ax.nvim.

CONFIGURATION ~

Ax doesn't require explicit configuration, but it can be customized if needed
through the setup function. Example:

    lua require('ax').setup({
      -- your configuration here
    })
